This goes through all the datasets I know about. ::

    for dataset in pluplusch():
        print(dataset)

You can tune it a bit with the parameters. ::

    pluplusch(catalogs = ['https://data.overheid.nl'], proxies = {},
              cache_dir = '/lockers/tlevine_vol/dadawarehouse.thomaslevine.com/big/pluplusch')
